# ts-template

A TypeScript monorepo template built for agent-generated code: bun, Turborepo, TypeScript 7, and eight quality gates that block CI.

The premise is that when agents write most of the code, review does not scale but gates do.

## Quick start

```sh
bun install
bun run ci
```

## Layout

```
apps/cli/              Example application. Zero dependencies, no build step.
packages/duration/     Example library. Demonstrates narrowing `unknown` at a trust boundary.
scripts/               Repo tooling: exceptions report, gate verification, init.
quality-exceptions.json  The only place file-level gate exceptions may live.
```

## The gates

| Gate                  | Threshold      | Command                |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Formatting            | clean          | `bun run format:check` |
| Cyclomatic complexity | < 22           | `bun run lint`         |
| Cognitive complexity  | < 22           | `bun run lint`         |
| Lines per file        | < 500          | `bun run lint`         |
| `any` types           | 0              | `bun run lint`         |
| Types                 | clean          | `bun run typecheck`    |
| Coverage              | 100%, per file | `bun run test`         |
| Dead code             | 0              | `bun run knip`         |
| Duplicated code       | 0              | `bun run dup`          |
| Surviving mutants     | 0              | `bun run mutate`       |

`bun run verify-gates` proves the gates actually reject bad code, by writing deliberately broken files and asserting each gate rejects them for the right reason. A gate that has silently stopped enforcing anything is the failure mode this repo is designed around.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **bun installs and runs scripts; Node runs tests.** Vitest treats bun as a package manager only, and the v8 coverage provider does not work on the bun runtime.
- **No build step anywhere.** Packages export TypeScript source directly. A compiled package that has not been built makes type-aware lint and knip exit 0 while enforcing nothing — a silent false pass.
- **Exact version pins, no ranges.** oxfmt is pre-1.0 with no semver protection on formatting output, and `oxlint-tsgolint` is hard-pinned to a TypeScript patch release.
- **bun's default isolated linker is kept.** It turns an undeclared dependency into an immediate failure instead of a latent bug.

## Starting a project from this template

```sh
bun run init @your-scope
```

Rewrites the package scope, updates the README, and removes itself.

## Known patch

`@stryker-mutator/vitest-runner@10.0.0` is patched via `bun patch` (see `patches/`).

Vitest 5 changed `testNamePattern` to match against a `" > "`-joined test name; the Stryker runner still joins with a single space, so every test nested in a `describe` is skipped and every mutant is reported as survived. Upstream: [stryker-js#6210](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-js/issues/6210).

The patch is pinned to exactly `10.0.0`. If Renovate bumps the runner, `patchedDependencies` stops matching and bun applies nothing — but it **fails closed**: unpatched, the score collapses to 3.33% and `thresholds.break: 100` reds the build. Remove the patch when the fix ships upstream.
